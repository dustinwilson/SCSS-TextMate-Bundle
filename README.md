# SCSS TextMate Bundle #

This is an alternate [SCSS][a] TextMate bundle for TextMate 2. It is a rather barebones bundle for my own purposes. Its language grammar utilizes and requires my [CSS language grammar][b] to function. This bundle is specifically for TextMate 2. It will not work in TextMate 1 or other programs which have borrowed TextMate's bundling system.

## Features ##

* Syntax highlights SCSS.
* Automatically saves CSS files in the same location as the SCSS file when SCSS files are saved using `âŒ˜S`.

## Installation ##

Double-click the bundle to install. TextMate will handle the rest.
